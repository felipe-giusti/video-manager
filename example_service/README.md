# Example Service

This is a placeholder example of a processing service from video input.

My other video generation / processing services are privated for now because I'm using them commercially.

(I will add references to videos on social media after I finish the services, so it is easier to understand this project)

I plan on adding some open source services here in the future, but I can't do that currently.

Examples of Video Generation Services I'm developing:
- Video Generation:
  - Physics Simulation Shorts (Almost completed)
  - Reddit / Social Media Story Reader (Started, on hold)
  - Video Clips from video (not started)
  
- Processing
  - Blur faces (Not started, Open Source)
